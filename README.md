# DFT-ML-excited-state-redox

This is the project page of our [paper](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-mkwmh) where we report our investigation about excited state redox potential calculations for orgainc photocatalysts. The repository contains all the data and Jupyter Notebooks we used for the analysis of our results. The notebooks are set up to be used with Google Colab.
